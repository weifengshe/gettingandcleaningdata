<h1>Codebook for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset</h1>

<p>the dataset came from 
Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - Universitâ€¡ degli Studi di Genova.
Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.
<a href="mailto:activityrecognition@smartlab.ws">activityrecognition@smartlab.ws</a>
<a href="http://www.smartlab.ws">www.smartlab.ws</a></p>

<p>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, The authers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. </p>

<p>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See &#39;features_info.txt&#39; for more details. </p>

<p>the following steps has been taken to analyze the data.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>merge the train and test data set together. </p>

<ul>
<li>x_train, y_train and subject_train are merged to Train</li>
<li>x_test, y_test and subject_test are merged to Test</li>
<li>Train and Test are merged to activityTotal</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Extract the mean and standard deviation measurement</p>

<ul>
<li>read in the features.txt file which represents each measurement for x_test and x_train</li>
<li>use the file to label the colnames of activityTotal</li>
<li>remove the punctuation from colnames</li>
<li>extract only the colnames with mean and std variables</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</p>

<ul>
<li>read in activities_labels.txt file which has the activities with repect to the number</li>
<li>then change the number ot discriptive activities according to this file. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
this step has been done together with step 2.
and the details of each variable are explained below.</p></li>
<li><p>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</p>

<ul>
<li>use aggregate function to calculate the mean for each activity and each subject</li>
<li>with the new data frame to a file: tidydata.csv</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>the details for each variable name:</p>

<p>&#39;t&#39; denotes time, the time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. </p>

<p>&#39;f&#39; donotes a fast fourier transform (FFT) was applied.</p>

<p>&#39;Acc-XYZ&#39; denotes accelerometer 3-axial signal.</p>

<p>&#39;Gyro-XYX&#39; denotes gyroscope 3-axial raw signal.</p>

<p>&#39;-XYZ&#39; is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.</p>
